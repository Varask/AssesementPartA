## Description
This project is part of the MSc: Computational & Software Techniques in Engineering Visualisation Assignment 2024/25. The application, built using Qt and OpenGL, offers an interactive menu to manipulate a 3D cube. Key features include a line rotation tool (rotating the cube around a user-defined line using a point, a direction vector, and a rotation angle), camera view adjustment using `glm::lookAt`, a default view reset, and an animation option that spins the cube around its rotation axis.

## Pre-requisites
- **Development Environment:**  
  - Qt Creator (IDE)
  - C++ compiler supporting C++11 or higher
- **Libraries & Frameworks:**  
  - Qt framework
  - OpenGL
  - GLM
